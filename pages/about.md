My name is Patrick O'Brien. I am a software engineer at a development company in Milwaukee, WI. There, I work as the lead of a small team to develop SaaS-based products using the .NET Framework and modern web development technologies, most recently tinkering with web components.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading other blog posts, playing around with new technologies, and play more video games than I probably should.
