A few years ago, I set out to create a blog for myself. After researching various CMSes, I stumbled on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), a pretty great, developer friendly CMS. I found a prebuilt theme, dropped it in the system, and started writing. 

But I wasn't really enjoying it. The site wasn't really "my own". It was someone else's, wrapping around my words.
