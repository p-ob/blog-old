I'm not really a big fan of these first time posts. This is typically just fluff to act as a nice starting bookend for the posts to follow. But, some of you readers might be curious to know a little about me, so here goes.

_Note that all of this is available in a much shorter format [here]({{< ref "../about.md" >}})._

My name is Patrick O'Brien, and I am a software engineer. More importantly, I am currently a .NET developer. I have three years of professional experience, and about five years extra through schooling and personal interests.

I've been able to dabble with a large variety of languages and technologies over the years. In addition to .NET development, just to name a few:

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Python
- Go

For the most part, I'm a full stack web developer; I've been lucky enough to be able to play with modern, if not bleeding-edge, web technologies, and it's the knowledge I've gotten from that that I'd like to share with you.

Feel free to comment on this post, especially with things that interest you most about .NET web development. And welcome to my blog!
